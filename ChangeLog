2003-12-14  Martin Bayer  <martin@gephex.org>  

	* Released 0.0.4

	* gui now spawns a new engine process if connect fails 
	  
	* changed names of menu-items in the gui 

	* added icon and about dialog to the gui 

	* changed graph format. Old graphs will not work. 

	* changed image source: removed automatic seeking and changed from an 
	[0,1] position input to [0, num_frames-1] position input
       
	* frboutmodule (unix only): ximage, xshm and gl output driver now use 
	the DISPLAY environment variable if their display-property is set to 
	"default"

	* removed debug messages 

	* added the ifs (iterated function system) effects to the win32 version

	* merged config files engine.conf and gui.conf to gephex.conf 

	* added wrapper script for better installation (example graphs are 
	installed under linux now, too)

	* fixed several bugs (some listed below)
	- fixed radio button
	- frboutmodule: crash if depth of the xserver is not 32 
	- frboutmodule: crash when using xshm driver on remote xserver 
	- isingnoize: crash when input size is set to zero
	- engine: memory leaks
	- network: fixed endianess issue in the protocol 

	* changed from debug to release target for engine and gui on win32 
	(unix version already was non-debug per default)	

2003-11-04  Martin Bayer  <bayer@fmi.uni-passau.de>  

	* Released 0.0.4beta2

	* removed nonfunctional and unneeded functionality
	- sequencer
	- playlist
	- tons of old and unneeded code
	- folders for graphs
        
	* fixed several open bugs
	- fixed crash when deleting module that is connected to a patched input
	- fixed bug that moved modules in the grapheditor
	- fixed engine crash when gui disconnects
	- fixed bug in protocol when the datareceiver throws an exception
	- enhanced robustness of protocol (resync)
	- fixed "lost value" problem of spinbox widget

	* gui and engine now run independent, when one app crashes the other 
	one continues

	* gui can detach from engine and reconnect later

	* improved startup speed (loading the plugins took very long before)

	* new modules:
	- font module that can use any true type font (uses sdl_ttf)
	- several more effecTV ports (sparkTV, quarkTV, ...)
	- pixelizer effect
	
	* new gl output driver in frboutmodule (uses textures)

	* more bugfixes and small improvements in engine, gui and modules

2003-10-09  Martin Bayer  <bayer@fmi.uni-passau.de>  

	* released 0.0.4alpha2
	  
	* audio type and some audio modules (beat detection works, but it's 
	still pretty dumb)

	* Grapheditor shows icons of the modules now

	* merged several modules for better usability:
	(plz see README if you want to convert old graphs)
	- all framebuffer outputs are merged into frboutmodule (the same module
	for linux and windows, this way the graphs are more portable) [note 
	that some outputs like glout and sdlout are commented out for the 
	moment due to their bad performance]
	- bmpmodule, avifilemodule, libmpeg3loader, videomodule, 
	directshowmodule are merged into frbinmodule (again only one module 
	for all plattforms)
	- addmodule and submodule have been merged into arithmodule (which now 
	can do a lot more than just addition and subtraction)
	- imgmulmodule, imgaddmodule, imgsubmodule, invertmodule have been 
	fixed and merged into imgarithmodule

	* all framebuffer output drivers now support control over brightness, 
	contrast, gamma

	* new aalib driver in frboutmodule

	* new modules: 
	- gradnormmoule  : shows the edges of an image
	- twolayermodule : turns an image to black and white
	- audio(in|out)module : in and output, supports alsa and os on posix 
	 platforms and wavein/out on win32
	 - audiobdmodule  : simple beat detection
	 
	* default graph is now edited and rendered graph at startup
    
	* removed output size from rotary zoomer, the size of the input 
	framebuffer is used instead
   
	* new check-box property widget

   	* fixed some bugs and glitches

2003-05-06  Martin Bayer  <bayer@fmi.uni-passau.de>
  
  
	* Released 0.0.4alpha1

  
	* NumberType changed from unsigned int (32 bit) to IEEE 64 bit floating
	point value. This changes nearly all effects.

	* Many bugfixes

	* Color-format and framebuffer orientation fixed to BGRA top down 
	(i.e. first line in memory ist upper most line)

	* Ported some effects from EffecTV

	* Improved the build system (library tests etc.)

	* Midiinput now works for Linux and WIN32

	* Updated the documentation

	* Avifile support for Linux

	* Isingnoize and IFS effects

	* Better control- and propertywidgets (refactored them to use common 
	code)
