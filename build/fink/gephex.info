DescDetail:<<
gephex is a modular video jockey software.
The base visuals can be chosen from sources like video files or cameras.
Then they can be modified by filters and mixers. Each modifier has several
parameters, that can be controlled by signal-generators, input devices
like joysticks, sound cards, or midi-devices.

gephex runs on GNU/Linux, Win32, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD.
The effect engine is independent from the user interface, which can
be de- and attached at runtime.
All effects and media streams are extendible by plugins.
gephex is written in C++.
