Where to get the source
------------------------

If this is a binary release, you can get the source at http://www.gephex.org.

ffmpeg
-------

The source release contains the ffmpeg sources in contrib/ffmpeg.
It's a recent cvs snapshot, and has not been modified.

Check http://ffmpeg.sf.net for details on ffmpeg.


EffecTV
--------

This release contains effects that have been ported from EffecTV
(http://effectv.sf.net).
The sources are in './effectvmodules'.

Thanks to the EffecTV people for their cool effects!


Important note:
---------------

  On unix platforms, the layout of the ~/.gephex directory has
  changed with 0.4.1. All files that previously have been
  in "~/.gephex/" are now moved to the new directory 
  "~/.gephex/0.4/". This change is done automatically when you first
  start gephex-0.4.1. Note that after that, you cannot simply start
  an older version of gephex, because it cannot find the config files
  and will create new ones.


For documentation, please have a look at doc/documentation.html 
or http://www.gephex.org.
