     to the source dist. From now on it is possible to build
     the windows binaries from the source dist (see README.win32).

        between modules (graph editor)

   * new and improved plugins
      * greatly improved performance of gradnormmodule,
        added different edge operators
      * new function parse module with 4 number inputs
        which can interpret arithmetic expressions
        (more flexible than the calculon module)
      * alsa driver for midi input
      * reactivated linux native joystick driver (now you
        don't need SDL to use the joystick on linux) 
      * rewrote and activated the direct show based video driver in the
        frbinmodule (image source)
      * block size in pixelizermodule can now be chosen independently for

        updates in some situations 
      * fixed bug (#29) of the install-exec-hook in the data
        dir
      * fixed "jumps" of the signal generator when frequency
        or signal type changes (bug #35)

-------

    * gui now spawns a new engine process if connect fails 

    * changed names of menu-items in the gui 

    * added icon and about dialog to the gui 

    * changed graph format. Old graphs will not work. 

    * changed image source: removed automatic seeking and
      changed from an [0,1] position input to [0, num_frames-1] position
      input

    * frboutmodule (unix only): ximage, xshm and gl output driver now use
      the DISPLAY environment variable if their display-property is set
      to "default"

    * removed debug messages 

    * added the ifs (iterated function system) effects to the win32
      version

       * frboutmodule: crash if depth of the xserver is not 32 
       * frboutmodule: crash when using xshm driver on remote xserver 
       * isingnoize: crash when input size is set to zero
       * engine: memory leaks
       * network: fixed endianess issue in the protocol 

    * changed from debug to release target for engine and gui on win32
      (unix version already was non-debug per default)

-----------


    * removed nonfunctional and unneeded code
       * sequencer
       * playlist
       * tons of old and unneeded code
       * folders for graphs


    * fixed several open bugs
       * fixed crash when deleting module that is connected
         to a patched input
       * fixed bug that moved modules in the graph editor
       * fixed engine crash when gui disconnects
       * fixed bug in protocol when the data-receiver throws an
         exception
       * enhanced robustness of protocol (re-sync)
       * fixed "lost value" problem of spin-box widget
        

    * gui and engine now run independent, when one app crashes
      the other one continues 

    * gui can detach from engine and reconnect later

    * improved startup speed (loading the plugins took very long before)

    * new modules:
       * font module that can use any true type font (uses
         sdl_ttf)
       * several more effecTV ports (sparkTV, quarkTV, ...)
       * pixelizer effect        

    * new gl output driver in frboutmodule (uses textures)

    * more bug fixes and small improvements in engine, gui and modules

      still pretty dumb) 

    * graph editor shows icons of the modules now

    * merged several modules for better usability:
      (please see README if you want to convert old graphs)
       * all framebuffer outputs are merged into frboutmodule
         (the same module for linux and windows, this way
         the graphs are more portable) [note that some outputs
         like glout and sdlout are commented out for the moment
         due to their bad performance]
        
       * bmpmodule, avifilemodule, libmpeg3loader, videomodule,
         directshowmodule are merged into frbinmodule
         (again only one module for all platforms)
        
       * addmodule and submodule have been merged into arithmodule
         (which now can do a lot more than just addition and
         subtraction)
        
       * imgmulmodule, imgaddmodule, imgsubmodule, invertmodule
         have been fixed and merged into imgarithmodule
        

    * all framebuffer output drivers now support control over
      brightness, contrast, gamma 

    * new aalib driver in frboutmodule

    * new modules:

       * twolayermodule      : turns an image to black and white
       * audio(in|out)module : in and output, supports alsa and OSS
         on posix platforms and wavein/out on win32
       * audiobdmodule       : simple beat detection

    * fixed some bugs and glitches



0.0.4alpha1
------------

      IEEE 64 bit floating point value.
      This changes nearly all effects.

    * Color-format and framebuffer orientation fixed to
      BGRA top down (i.e. first line in memory is upper most line)

    * Ported some effects from EffecTV

    * Improved the build system (library tests etc.)

    * Midi input now works for Linux and WIN32

    * Updated the documentation
